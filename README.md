A from scratch database in Java for printers and toners. This project uses 
JavaFX for a GUI and follows the model view controller design pattern. JAXB was
used for XML binding as well as importing and exporting the database. Pictures 
and a tutorial of the functionality can be found in the User Manual PDF. Java
docs were also generated.
